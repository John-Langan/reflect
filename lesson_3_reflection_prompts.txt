Add reflections for Lesson 3
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Fill in your answer here
As soon as some code has been written and/or other files have been created for my project. This ensures there is a back up in case my local machine has a problem.

This is also essential if other people are involved in the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Gives the user more control over their work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A user forks someone elses repository so they can have their own copy of it in their github account. A repositry is cloned to create a copy of the repository, often from github to a local machine. A branch is where changes can be made to the code or conten without affecting the master branch. Often for experimental work.
