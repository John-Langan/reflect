    Fill in your answer here
As soon as some code has been written and/or other files have been created for my project. This ensures there is a back up in case my local machine has a problem.

This is also essential if other people are involved in the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Gives the user more control over their work.
